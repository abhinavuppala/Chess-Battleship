# Chess-Battleship
A version of the traditional Chess game written in python (pygame), with an additional twist: you can't see enemy positions, similar to Battleship in which you have to guess where your opponent placed their ships! Created for a UCI ICS 60 project, solely by me (Abhinav Uppala).

## How to play

Video Demo - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRAV-_lgdqw

The game follows the same rules as chess, with white going first and alternating. Additionally, checks, pins, captures, checkmate, etc. all work the same way as regular chess. The only difference is that you cannot see the opposing side's pieces on your turn.

In order to move a piece, click on the piece you wish to move, and then click one of the highlighted squares showing the legal moves that piece can make in this position (this could provide insight into enemy pieces blocking yours, a pin on your piece, etc.). Clicking the piece's current square will deselect it.

## How to run the game

In order to run the game, download chess-battleship.zip, extract the file contents (making sure to keep chess_sprites folder in the same directory as the executable) and then run main.exe to play the game. The rest of the files in the repo are the source code.

Note: there may be an issue where you can't run main.exe since Windows doesn't recognize the publisher, still trying to find a workaround for this. If this is the case, just watch the video demo to get a sense for the gameplay.
